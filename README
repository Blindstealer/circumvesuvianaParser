== Description ==
=================
This is a parser for the web page "http://teleindicatore.eavsrl.it", which contains informations updated in real time about EAV (Ente Autonomo Volturno) trains starting from Neaples Terminal Station (Napoli - Porta nolana) to others end of line stations.
The parser developed transforms the plain HTML content of the web page in a more flexible JSON format that can be easily used by third part apps.

This parser uses nodejs and some modules are requested to function:
	- request (which allow to get the web page)
	- cheerio (a jquery interpeter used to transform the web page in JSON format)
This parser was tested on Ubuntu Server 14.04

===========
== Usage ==
